## 📘 Project Description  

The **Smart Warranty Registration & Validation System** is a blockchain-based solution for securely recording and verifying product warranties.  
It replaces traditional paper or centralized warranty systems with a decentralized ledger that ensures transparency, security, and trust between manufacturers and buyers.  

---

## 💡 What It Does  

- Manufacturers can **register** warranties for products using a unique serial number.  
- Buyers can **check** if their warranty is still valid directly on the blockchain.  
- Ownership of a product (and its warranty) can be **transferred** in case of resale.  
- Manufacturers can **revoke** warranties if fraud or tampering is detected.  

This system ensures that all warranty records are **tamper-proof**, **publicly verifiable**, and **permanently stored** on the Ethereum network.

## ✨ Features  

✅ **Warranty Registration** — Only the manufacturer (contract deployer) can register new warranties.  
✅ **Ownership Transfer** — Buyers can transfer warranty ownership securely on-chain.
